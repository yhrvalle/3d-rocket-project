This project was created alongside the Section 3 of the Complete C# Unity 3D Game Development Udemy Course.

In this project besides the Unity Content, I'll be learning to use an workflow that uses Jira, Branches for features and for subtaks from Jira and probably in the future use Confluence for Tech Design, probably in another project.

- Jira for Task and Subtasks
- Git branches
    - EX-1/Feature
        - EX-2/Sub1
        - EX-3/Sub2
        - EX-4/Sub3
        - EX-5/Sub4
    - For each subtasks will open a PR for the previous task
- Confluence for Tech Design
    - Code Architecture
    - UML Diagrams
    - Etc

Those things feels kinda overkill for those small sized projects but I heard that is necessary for larger/entreprise
